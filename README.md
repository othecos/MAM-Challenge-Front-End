### Configuring environments

1. Since this application uses Google Maps, you **must** provide `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` in the `.env.local`

    - You can generate this API KEY [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

2. You also must config your `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST`.
   <br>
   You can use our ready to use server that was provided in the `.env.example` , or connect to local instance.

3. In the end of this steps, your `.env.local` should look like this

    ```sh
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=AIzaSyAIo1JFFQDuBesadasdasd-dsa3CAxnBHzE
    NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=https://mam-challenge-backend.herokuapp.com/
    NEXT_PUBLIC_VERSION="v1"
    ```

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

#

 

## Testing

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```

#

## CI/CD (Vercel)

**_Obs:. You should create environment variables in the Vercel to make it work, since the .env files aren't upload to Github_**
